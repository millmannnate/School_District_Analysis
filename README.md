# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
This challenge anaylsis was a revisement of the original school district analysis. School and student data was summarized in the original project. Due to an issue with academic dishonesty with Thomas High School's ninth graders, we were asked to remove their data from the pool and reperform the analysis.
## Results
* How is the district summary affected?
It doesn't appear to affect the district summary for the decimal places we rounded to.
* How is the school summary affected?
Thomas High School's percentages went slightly down from where they were at before 9th graders were removed. The math scores when slightly down and the reading scores went up slightly.
* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
The removal of the ninth graders' scores didn't affect where Thomas High School stood compared to other schools.
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  * Math and reading scores by grade:
  Math and reading scores appeared to be the same.
  * Scores by school spending:
  Schools with $630-$644 spent per student had reading scores go slightly up and math scores go slightly down.
  * Scores by school size:
  Medium-sized schools had reading scores go slightly up and math scores go slightly down.
  * Scores by school type:
  Charter schools had reading scores go slightly up and math scores go slightly down.
## Summary
The changes that occured in the tables were consistent accross the board when the 9th grade data was changed to NaN. Scores by grade was formatted down to less decimal places and I was unable to see changes in that table. It would make logical sense for that to also change just slightly along with the other tables. Any of the groupings that Thomas High School was a part of showed an increase in reading scores and a decrease in math scores. The percentages for passing that involved Thomas all decreased slightly despite an increase in average reading scores.
